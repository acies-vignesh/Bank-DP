  # Schema Validation Checks
  - schema:
      name: Ensure essential transaction columns are present
      warn:
        when required column missing: [transaction_id, event_time, customer_id, amount, transaction_status]
      attributes:
        category: Schema
        title: Essential columns are critical for processing and understanding every transaction.

  - schema:
      name: Validate transaction_id column type
      warn:
        when type changed: transaction_id
        from: [string]
      attributes:
        category: Schema
        title: Transaction IDs must remain consistent in type for reliable joins and unique identification.

  - schema:
      name: Validate amount and balance column types
      warn:
        when type changed: [amount, balance_before, balance_after]
        from: [number]
      attributes:
        category: Schema
        title: Monetary values and balances must be numeric for accurate financial calculations.

  # Validity Checks
  - invalid_count(amount) = 0:
      valid min: 0.01 # Assuming transactions must have a positive amount, adjust if 0 is valid for certain types
      name: Transaction amount should be positive
      attributes:
        category: Validity
        title: Negative or zero transaction amounts (unless for specific refunds) can indicate data errors or unusual activity.

  - invalid_count(transaction_status) = 0:
      valid values: [Completed, Failed, Pending, Reversal] # Adjust based on your specific statuses
      name: Transaction status should have valid values
      attributes:
        category: Validity
        title: Transaction status must conform to defined states for accurate operational reporting and workflow management.

  - invalid_count(transaction_id) = 0:
      valid min length: 16 # Example length, adjust to your actual ID length
      valid max length: 32 # Example length, adjust to your actual ID length
      name: Transaction ID should have a valid length
      attributes:
        category: Validity
        title: Consistent transaction ID length is crucial for data parsing, storage efficiency, and system integration.

  - invalid_count(event_time) = 0:
      valid format: 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS' # Or your specific datetime format
      name: Event time should have a valid format
      attributes:
        category: Validity
        title: Accurate and consistently formatted timestamps are essential for time-series analysis, auditing, and freshness checks.

  # Completeness Checks
  - missing_count(transaction_id) = 0:
      name: Transaction ID should not have any missing values
      attributes:
        category: Completeness
        title: A missing transaction ID renders the record unusable for tracking and reconciliation.

  - missing_count(customer_id) = 0:
      name: Customer ID should not have any missing values
      attributes:
        category: Completeness
        title: Missing customer IDs prevent linking transactions to customer profiles, hindering segmentation and behavioral analysis.

  - missing_count(amount) = 0:
      name: Transaction amount should not have any missing values
      attributes:
        category: Completeness
        title: Missing transaction amounts invalidate financial reporting and prevent calculations of revenue or volume.

  - missing_percent(transaction_channel) < 5: # Allowing up to 5% missing for optional fields
      name: Transaction channel should not have missing values more than 5%
      attributes:
        category: Completeness
        title: High completeness for transaction channel is important for understanding user behavior and optimizing channel strategies.

  # Uniqueness Checks
  - duplicate_count(transaction_id) = 0:
      name: Transaction ID should be unique
      attributes:
        category: Uniqueness
        title: Duplicate transaction IDs lead to inflated counts and incorrect financial reporting, compromising data integrity.
